These php files are for a forum program that I wrote.

index.php is the top level file

Before running this program, make sure to run mosteit_forum.sql through mysql.

In order to simplify demonstration, the desired username is required for each
post. This is simpler than having to login and out multiple times.

Thanks for checking out my code.
